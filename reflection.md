# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design

**a. Initial design**

- Briefly describe your initial UML design.
- What classes did you include, and what responsibilities did you assign to each?
My initial UML design included four classes. Owner holds owner identity and maintains a collection of pets. Pet represents a single animal with attributes like breed and age, and keeps its own list of tasks. Task is a dataclass for a single care event and it stores what the task is, when it's scheduled, its priority, and whether it recurs. Scheduler is the central coordinator that holds all tasks and pets and exposes the algorithmic methods for sorting, filtering, conflict detection, and recurring task generation.

**b. Design changes**

- Did your design change during implementation?
- If yes, describe at least one change and why you made it.

The AI flagsged two problems.
Change 1: Task had no way to identify its pet. I added pet_id: str to Task. Now detect_conflicts() and show_daily_summary() can group tasks by pet.
Change 2: Scheduler kept its own tasks list separate from Pet.tasks. This meant two copies of the same data that could drift out of sync. I replaced it with a @property that flattens tasks from all pets. Now pets are the single source of truth.

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

- What constraints does your scheduler consider (for example: time, priority, preferences)?
- How did you decide which constraints mattered most?

**b. Tradeoffs**

- Describe one tradeoff your scheduler makes.
- Why is that tradeoff reasonable for this scenario?

## 3. AI Collaboration

**a. How you used AI**

- How did you use AI tools during this project (for example: design brainstorming, debugging, refactoring)?
- What kinds of prompts or questions were most helpful?

**b. Judgment and verification**

- Describe one moment where you did not accept an AI suggestion as-is.
- How did you evaluate or verify what the AI suggested?

---

## 4. Testing and Verification

**a. What you tested**

- What behaviors did you test?
- Why were these tests important?

**b. Confidence**

- How confident are you that your scheduler works correctly?
- What edge cases would you test next if you had more time?
